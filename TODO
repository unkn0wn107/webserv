- TIMEOUT: alex
- cache: a & mat
- errno on accept: mat ok
- test cross sieges (multiple socket): mat ok
- Because you wonâ€™t call the CGI directly, use the full path as PATH_INFO: alex
- Just remember that, for chunked request, your server needs to unchunk it, the CGI will expect EOF as end of the body: (on verra)
- Same things for the output of the CGI. If no content_length is returned from the CGI, EOF will mark the end of the returned data: mat ok
- The CGI should be run in the correct directory for relative path file access: alex
